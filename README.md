1. Change variables accordingly (see section `Environment Variables`)
1. Then start server

Either run with docker

  docker compose up --build
```

or npm

cd web
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Environment Variables

If you want to test this project, you need to copy variables from `.env.example` to `.env` and fill some variables with your values. 



Most values are self-explanatory, are fine for local testing and don't have to be changed, but some values are confidential should be registered correctly. 

This is list of variables that should be changed for local development:

```
VITE_IDENTITY_AUTH_URL=https://login.e-infra.cz/oidc
VITE_IDENTITY_ISSUER=https://login.e-infra.cz/oidc
VITE_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID=my-client
```
Used for logging in via OIDC. Need to use correct e-infra OIDC server. Values for testing MetaProject Zeus OIDC server won't be public and will be provided by other channel.


## Deployment

When deploying this project, you have to build static files locally (in future, this process can be part of production pipeline).

First navigate to `web` folder

```
cd web
```

Then install `node_modules` (if you ran `docker compose up`, `node_modules` folder may have permission conflicts so it is better to delete it first, if exists)

```
rm -rf node_modules && npm i
```

Then build production application

```
npm run build
```

Resulting application is in `web/dist/` folder. It's only static HTML and JS, you can copy it to webserver.
